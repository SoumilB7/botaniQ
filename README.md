## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors capture real-time environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light levels.  

2. **Processing & Analysis**: The Arduino processes the data, while the ESP8266 transmits it to a cloud platform for further analysis.  

3. **Image Capture & Plant Identification**: Users can capture an image of the plant, which is then analyzed to identify its species and added as a card for tracking.  

4. **IoT Connectivity**: The system sends real-time updates to a cloud dashboard, allowing users to monitor plant health remotely.  

5. **User Interface**: Data and images are displayed on a web or mobile dashboard, providing insights into plant care.  

6. **Automated Alerts**: The system notifies users when conditions become unfavorable, ensuring timely intervention.
